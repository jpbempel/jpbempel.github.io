# PrintAssembly output explained!
If you are a regular reader of my blog, you may have noticed that I am (ab)using (of) the [PrintAssembly options](https://jpbempel.github.io/2012/10/16/how-to-print-disassembly-from-JIT-code.html) from the JVM to examine the code generated by the JIT compiler. It helps me a lot to understand how my code is executed, and how the JIT compiler works and optimize the code.
Even if from time to time I use also JMH, I am not a big fan of benchmarking and especially micro-benchmarking.

Why? Because micro-benchmarking is an idealization of how the production code is executed: tight loops, all data into the L1 cache and hot, few branch misses, best case for aggressive JIT optimizations (like monomorphic calls, etc.)

The thing is, the execution context in production is totally different from micro-benchmarks, so what's the point in exercising a code that will not be executed in the same condition? Are the conclusions that I can draw from the micro-benchmark still valid or still beneficial for my production cases?
All of this, push me away from micro-benchmark as much as possible and try to find another way to evaluate the performance like performance counters inserted directly into the application or reading the assembly generated by the JIT compiler. Note also that it is not perfect either as nowadays CPU are out-of-order in execution and also perform Instruction Level Parallelism. So benchmarking in some situations are the only way to assess performance.

Printing assembly helps me also to back assertions about how JIT optimizes instead of relying on some folklore and urban legends ([reordering of instructions, memory barriers](https://jpbempel.github.io/2015/05/26/volatile-and-memory-barriers.html), ...).

With all of that, PrintAssembly is one of my favorite tools. But I can understand the output of this may be difficult to read. Nowadays, not all developers are familiar with assembly, unfortunately, but with some basic knowledge and with the help of comments inserted, it can be less cryptic.

For those who have never used PrintAssembly please refer to my previous posts about it: [How to print dissassembly from JIT code](https://jpbempel.github.io/2012/10/16/how-to-print-disassembly-from-JIT-code.html) and [How to build hsdis-amd64.dll](https://jpbempel.github.io/2013/07/02/how-to-build-hsdis-amd64-dll.html). [Chris Newland](https://twitter.com/chriswhocodes), creator of [JITWatch tool](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/jitwatch), has also some useful tips for [Mac OS X](https://www.chrisnewland.com/building-hsdis-amd64dylib-on-mac-osx-376). [Nitsan Wakart](https://twitter.com/nitsanw) wrote an [article](http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.fr/2013/01/java-print-assembly.html) on this.

Your setup is done? Perfect let's read some assembly, yeah!

## Assembly 101
First of all, I am using intel syntax, not AT&T one. I am used to this syntax, and because we are talking about x86 instruction set made by Intel let's stick to their convention.
Reminder: To get this syntax with the disassembler plugin, use the JVM option:
`-XX:PrintAssemblyOptions=intel`

Instruction lines are decomposed as the following:

```
mnemonic parameters
```
`mnemonic` is the instruction name (mov, call, add, jmp, cmp, ...)
`parameters` can be register, memory accesses, immediate values
Examples:

```
mov rax, 0x2A
mov rdx, QWORD PTR [rbx+0x571c418]
```
`mov` instruction is a data movement. The first line move the constant value `0x2A` into the register `rax`.
The second line, move the memory content at the address computed from the value of regiser `rbx` and the constant value `0x571c418` into the register `rdx`. Note that order is reversed for AT&T syntax.

`push`/`pop` instructions move data to/from the stack
`add`/`sub`/`imul`/`idiv` instructions perform addition/subtraction/multiplication/division on integers
`inc`/`dec` instructions increment/decrement value in registers or memory
`and`/`or`/`xor`/`not`/`shl`/`shr` instructions perform bitwise operations
`jmp` instruction performs a unconditional jump to the specified address
`jxx` instructions perform a conditional jump based on the result of the related last operation
`cmp` instruction performs a comparison between 2 operands
`call`/`ret` instruction perform call to /return from a subroutine

For more information see this [guide](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html) for example or the official Intel documentation.

## Disassembler comments
Hopefully, disassembler plugin does not spit raw instructions but annotate them with useful information.
Let's take an example with the method ArrayList.add(Object) and analyze it:
        public boolean add(E e) {
L458        ensureCapacityInternal(size + 1);  // Increments modCount!!
L459        elementData[size++] = e;
            return true;
        }

Header
In the header we can find the following information:
# {method} {0x000000000ac640f8} 'add' '(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z' in 'java/util/ArrayList'
# this:     rdx:rdx   = 'java/util/ArrayList'

#           [sp+0x40]  (sp of caller)
view rawArrayList_add.header.asm hosted with ❤ by GitHub
The first line is the name of the method disassembled: 'add' with its signature: one parameter of type Object returning a boolean from the class java.util.ArrayList
But as this is a instance method there is in fact 2 parameters as mentioned in the rest of the header:
Parameter this which is stored in register rdx, and the Object parameter in register r8.

The following comment: ; - java.util.ArrayList::add@-1 (line 458)gives us the mapping to the Java code: class name, method name and bytecode offset into the method, and finally the line number into the original Java source file. For this prologue, as we do not have a specific bytecode associated we've got the -1 offset. For the first one: ;*synchronization entry, it indicates the prologue of the function: some instructions that are necessary to prepare the execution (stack allocation or stack banging, saving some registers, ...)

Next comment retrieves the field named from the current instance (ArrayList). It is translated to the following assembly line: mov r9d,DWORD PTR [rdx+0x10]
it moves into r9 register the content of the address rdx (this instance, cf method parameter) + 0x10 offset where the size field is located.

The following comment is interesting because we have the same type of bytecode getfield but the mapping to the Java code involved 2 methods: java.util.ArrayList::ensureCapacityInternal@1 (line 223)and java.util.ArrayList::add@7 (line 458). Implicitly, it means that the JIT has inlined the first method mentionned and the byte code come from this method.
        private static final Object[] DEFAULTCAPACITY_EMPTY_ELEMENTDATA = {};
    
        private void ensureCapacityInternal(int minCapacity) {

{oop(a 'java/lang/Object'[0])}indicates an instance (oop) with the following type 'java/lang/Object'[0]'. It means object array. This is in fact the constant instance empty array against which we are comparing inside the inlined method ensureCapacityInternal.

view rawArrayList_add.ImplicitNullCheck.asm hosted with ❤ by GitHub
New kind of comment: Here we have an implicit null check because we are dereferencing the object array elementData to get the length of it. (Java code: elementData.length). If elementData is null, JVM must throw a NullPointerException in this case. But, too avoid generating code for each object dereferenced, JIT relies on OS signal handling for segfault to handle this rare case. See my article on this technique. 

Type Check
Let's skip some regular comments to stop on this one
0x0000000002d2a7d3: cmp    r10d,0x200022ee    ;   {metadata('java/lang/Object'[])}
view rawArrayList_add.TypeCehck.asm hosted with ❤ by GitHub
We are verifying the current instance elementData class (metadata) is an object array ('java/lang/Object'[]). For performing this, we are getting from the instance the class pointer that we compare to the address of the class loaded by the JVM.

Here this is not a synchronization entry, but a special operation called 'card marking' that is performed after a write of a reference into a field or a reference array (elementData in our case). Card marking generated assembly is analyzed in this article. In this case we have card marking for element in an array, but for regular instance field, the generated assembly is different.

Finally, the comment {poll_return}indicates that the instruction performs a safepoint check. You will see this at the end of all methods. For more details about safepoints, please read my article and, a more detailed exploration of safepoints and impact here.

Voilà! You have the basics to understand the disassembly output from PrintAssembly options. I strongly recommend, again, if you want to go further to use the wonderful JITWatch tool.
